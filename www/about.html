	    <h3>What is Centi?</h3>
	    <p>Centi is a framework for building anonymous networks upon controlled communication channels.
	       It is made in order to give people in censured countries access to anonymous and secure communications
	       even if only dictatorish services will work.</p>
	    <p>Centi is not magic, although it is designed to make all of the network participants as anonymous as possible
	       in given situation.</p>
	    <p>The core of Centi network is its modules. They allow people to send and receive messages in relatively
	       secure manner.</p>

	    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
	    <p>Centi uses the same principles as Hidden Lake anonymous network. All the participants have some kind
	       of messages queue, which stores both fake and real packets. Every packet is sent to all the network participants,
	       so there is no way for outside observer to know who is the receiver. It is also impossible for the observer to
	       know if the packet is fake or real because they have the same size and structure.</p>
	    <p>Centi does not use some ideas as Hidden Lake, for example, fixed time of packet sending, because of
	       bot-banning systems and EDRs.</p>
	    <p>Centi also has it's variant of data polymorphism. At least it should, I did not finished the network yet.</p>

	    <h3>Physical security and network latency of Centi</h3>
	    <p>Centy tries to be as silent as possible, utilizing steganography algorithms in order to hide packet's presense.
	       The program also keeps all the databases and configuration files encrypted. Optionally, you can turn log
	       encryption on, if you want.</p>

	    <h3>Current state of the project</h3>
	    <p>Centi project is under active development. If you want to contribute, feel free to create a fork
	       and submit merge requests.</p>
