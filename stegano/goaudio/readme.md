GoAudio is an audio processing library, currently supporting `WAVE` files, although some tools such
as the synth and breakpoints are encoding-agnostic, so you could combine them with a different
library for storing the data and using GoAudio only as a means to generate the waveforms.

# Features

- [Wave file handling](wave)(READ / WRITE Wave files)
- [Synthesizer](synthesizer) - Create different waveforms using different types of oscillators
- [Breakpoints](breakpoint) (create automation tracks / envelopes)

If you want to know more about how this code works and what you can do with it, I write about this code and other audio related programs over on my [blog:
