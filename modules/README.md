# Modules
This part of repository contains modules for platform clients which can be used for communications. In order to be able to use a module, it must be registered.

Currently working modules:
- Gitea
- TLS
- HuggingFace (works only for one person)
- GitHub (also works for one person, because bans the way the module works, probably considers our accounts as bot)

There is also a space for usage such platforms as Discord, email clients, bluetooth, etc. All you need is just a technical realisation.
